 A all too common work flow/environment problem that I am experiencing right now ...
 I looked at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan.
 It uses a stack data structure I want to use.
 So I looked at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Stack-0.4.0/docs/Data-Stack.html
 I want to use it.
 Now I struggle finding the right import statement to use the stack data structure into GHCI.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Stack-0.4.0/docs/src/Data.Stack.html#Stack shows a module "Data.Stack"
   Î»> import Data.Stack

   <no location info>: error:
      Could not find module `Data.Stack'
      It is not a module in the current program, or in any known package.

  I don't know now if I need to add a dependency in the package.yaml  or the stack data structure is
  listed by another name in the base library.  Nor do I know how to find out.

  I now want to look at https://www.stackage.org/

  I could not find the Data.Stack hacakge.org code on Stackage.org

  https://www.stackage.org/package/containers

  added "containers" in package.yaml dependencies
